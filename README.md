# Chess Game using Python

This repo is for Chess game project made using Pygame and it uses OOPs principles as there are classes for GUI.

It is just plain and simple 2 player chess but it supports all chess features like move validation, Check-Checkmate-Stalemate detection, Pawn promotion, Castling and En-passant.

Apart from all valid chess logic, I have also added interactive GUI that lets user know which side is to make the move, if a performed move is legal or not, events when check/checkmate/pawn promotion and stalemate occurs.

Currently only background music is added which can be toggled on or off. I plan to add more sound effects in the future

Requirements:
1) Python 3.8
2) Pygame

How to play:

Ensure that you have Python 3.8 and pygame installed. After that run main.py using terminal or a python IDE such as Visual studio code or Pycharm  

Users can refer below resources on how to install python and pygame:

Windows users can follow these simple steps:

1) Run python3 command, if it is already installed, we will get output as below. If it is not installed, Windows will automatically begin its installation

3) Navigate to the folder where the main.py file is located and run python3 main.py in terminal

To disable background music, please set music_flag to False. You can find this variable in main.py
